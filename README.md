The DT package is an interface between R and the JavaScript DataTables library (RStudio DT documentation). In Example 3 (at this page) they show how to heatmap-format a table. This post modifies the example to

    1.format each column individually
    2.shade in green rather than red
    3.use base R syntax rather than piping
    4.omit the extra accoutrements of the displayed table (from the answer to this stackoverflow post), except
    5.include a title.
